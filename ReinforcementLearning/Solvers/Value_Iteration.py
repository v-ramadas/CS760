                    `probability` will be probability of `next_state` actually being the next state
                    `reward` is the short-term/immediate reward for achieving that next state
                    `done` is a boolean of wether or not that next state is the last/terminal state

                    Every action has a chance (at least theortically) of different outcomes (states)
                    Which is why `self.env.P[state][action]` is a list of outcomes and not a single outcome

                    This is a numpy array, but you can think of it as a dictionary

                    represents the value of a state. This value should become
                    more accurate with each episode.

                    How should this be calculated?
                        look at the value iteration algorithm
